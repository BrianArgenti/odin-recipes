    <p>Chocolate chip cookies are a simple delicious treat that can be enjoyed any time of the day. Dunk in milk, crumble over ice cream, create a cookie sandwich with frosting, or just eat them plain! It's easy to see why chocolate chip cookies (or C3 as I like to call them) are so popular.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together; set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat brown sugar, melted butter, and white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in egg, egg yolk, and vanilla until light and creamy; add flour mixture and stir until dough is just combined. Stir in chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Drop spoonfuls of dough 3 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 15 to 17 minutes. Cool on the cookie sheets briefly before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>        
    </ol>
